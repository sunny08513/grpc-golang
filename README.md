Rest API(Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) vs GRPC(gRPC Remote Procedure Calls))

Rest API  
1. Protocol
   - Use HTTP1.1 or HTTP 2
   - STandard HTTP method GET, POST, PUT , DELETE
2. Data Format 
   - Usually use JSON format.
   - They can support other formats as well XML, HTML or Plain text.
3.  Statelessness:
   - Each HTTP request from a client to server must contain all the information 
     the server needs to fulfill the request (stateless).
4. Performance:
   - JSON is text-based and can be slower to parse and larger in size compared to binary formats.
     REST can have higher latency due to the overhead of HTTP/1.1

GRPC 
1. Protocol
   - HTTP 2
   - which allows for multiplexing multiple requests on a single TCP connection, reducing latency and improving performance.
2. Data Format:
   - gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for data serialization(Data serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed later.), which is a compact binary format.
3. Efficiency:
   - Protobuf is more efficient in terms of size and speed compared to JSON.
4. Streaming:
   - gRPC natively supports four types of APIs: unary (single request-response), 
     server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming, 
     making it more versatile for real-time communication.
5. Strong Typing:
   - Protobuf provides a strongly typed schema, 
     which helps in ensuring data integrity and provides better contract definitions.
6. Performance:
   - gRPC generally has lower latency and higher performance due to the binary format 
   and HTTP/2 features like multiplexing and header compression.
7. Use Cases:
   - gRPC is well-suited for microservices communication, high-performance internal APIs,
     real-time data streaming, and environments where low latency is critical.
8. Error Handling:
   - Uses its own status codes and metadata to provide more detailed error information.

Use REST if:
    You need wide accessibility and ease of use, especially for public APIs.
    Human readability and ease of debugging are important.
    You are building traditional web applications with browsers as clients.
Use gRPC if:
    You need high performance and low latency.
    You are working on microservices architecture with internal services.
    You require real-time data streaming.
    You prefer strong typing and a well-defined contract between client and server.

######For an e-commerce website with multiple microservices, deciding where to use REST APIs and where to use gRPC depends on the specific requirements of each interaction between services. Hereâ€™s a practical guide to help you make these decisions:

##When to Use REST API
 1. Public APIs:
    Use REST for APIs that are exposed to external clients, such as mobile apps, third-party services, or web clients.
    REST's widespread use and JSON format make it easy to consume by a variety of clients.
 2. Client-Facing Services:
    Use REST for services that interact directly with the frontend, such as the product catalog, user authentication, and order placement.
    The stateless nature of REST and human-readable JSON format is beneficial for these services.

##When to Use gRPC
1. Internal Microservices Communication:
    Use gRPC for internal communication between microservices where performance is critical.
    Examples include interactions between the inventory management, order processing, and payment services.
2. High Performance and Low Latency:
    Use gRPC for services requiring low latency and high throughput.
    Examples include real-time recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, and inventory updates.



Key Aspects of Data Integrity
    1. Accuracy: Data should be correct and free from errors.
    2. Consistency: Data should be uniform and consistent across different systems and instances.
    3. Reliability: Data should be reliable and usable for its intended purpose without being compromised or altered unintentionally.
